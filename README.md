# What we are doing here?
We develop an balloon for the Stratosphere. We are a small group of students from a bording school in southern Germany, near Ulm. In 2014 we had the idea to develop and launch an balloon into the Stratosphere. Our first balloon launched on 21 March 2015 during the partial solar eclipse in Europe. At almost 22 km, our balloon, filled with helium, burst. The capsule landed save, hanging on a parachute.


Now we are developing our second balloon. We target this launch in Spring  2016.
